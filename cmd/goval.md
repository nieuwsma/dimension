Certainly! Here's a breakdown of each line of the expression with its corresponding plain English explanation:

1. `(b || !b)`
    - The sphere `b` can be present or absent. This is essentially a tautological condition, stating that any configuration regarding `b` is valid.

2. `(c || !c)`
    - The sphere `c` can be present or absent. Similar logic as for `b`.

3. `(d || !d)`
    - The sphere `d` can be present or absent.

4. `(e || !e)`
    - The sphere `e` can be present or absent.

5. `(f || !f)`
    - The sphere `f` can be present or absent.

6. `(g || !g)`
    - The sphere `g` can be present or absent.

7. `((h && b && c && a) || !h)`
    - If sphere `h` is present, then spheres `b`, `c`, and `a` must also be present. Otherwise, if `h` is absent, the configuration is still valid.

8. `((i && c && d && a) || !i)`
    - If sphere `i` is present, then spheres `c`, `d`, and `a` must also be present. If `i` is not present, the configuration is still valid.

9. `((j && d && e && a) || !j)`
    - If sphere `j` is present, then spheres `d`, `e`, and `a` must also be present. If `j` is not present, the configuration is still valid.

10. `((k && e && f && a) || !k)`
    - If sphere `k` is present, then spheres `e`, `f`, and `a` must also be present. If `k` is not present, the configuration is still valid.

11. `((l && f && g && a) || !l)`
    - If sphere `l` is present, then spheres `f`, `g`, and `a` must also be present. If `l` is not present, the configuration is still valid.

12. `((m && g && b && a) || !m)`
    - If sphere `m` is present, then spheres `g`, `b`, and `a` must also be present. If `m` is not present, the configuration is still valid.

13. `((!h && !i && !j && !k && !l && !m) || a)`
    - If all the spheres from the tropical ring (`h` to `m`) are absent, the configuration is valid. If any of them are present, then sphere `a` must be present.

14. `(!n || (n && ((h && j && l) || (i && k && m)) && a && b && c && d && e && f && g))`
    - If `n` is present, then either `h`, `j`, `l` or `i`, `k`, `m` must be present along with `a` and all the spheres from the first outer ring (`b` to `g`). If `n` is absent, the configuration is valid.

15. `(((h && j && l) || (i && k && m) || !n) || ((h && k && !i && !j && !l && !m) || (i && l && !h && !j && !k && !m) || (j && m && !h && !i && !k && !l)))`
    - The tropical ring can have the combination `h`, `j`, `l` or `i`, `k`, `m` regardless of whether `n` is present. Alternatively, it can have only two spheres like `h` and `k`, `i` and `l`, or `j` and `m`, without any other tropical sphere present.

That should give a comprehensive understanding of the boolean expression in plain English terms!
